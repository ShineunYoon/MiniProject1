Functionality

  The App is designed to be used by shoe retailers to track user reviews of brands/models of shoes. Also, the App would be able to potentially measure enthusiasm about a certain product before release. The system design for this App is broken into two major components:
  
    1. Twitter Listing on the Certain Search Keyword
    2. Sentiment Analysis on the Certain Product
  
  
  The first component involves accessing  and providing tweets via the Tweepy API that contain a certain keyword or hashtag obtained from the user. The user can also specify the desired number of tweets required. The second component involves performing a sentiment analysis on the received tweets using the google natural language API and then outputting an overall sentiment score to the user.
